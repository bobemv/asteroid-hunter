Little runner about a starship recollecting coins/objectives while dodging and destroying asteroids. Destruction is being done with 3D Marching Cubes. Starting point given by @josemorval: https://github.com/josemorval/MarchingCubes-Unity/

To understand the algorithm, these resources were essential too:



## Things I have learnt/done

- 3D Marching Cubes, building a mesh from it and destructing it little by little. These resources helped me to understand it: 
    - "Coding Aventure: Marching Cubes" by Sebastian Lague. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3iI2l0ltbE
    - "Marching Cubes Animation | Algorithms Visualized" by Algorithms Visualized. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_xk71YopsA
- UV Mapping to procedural meshes (Triplannar mapping).
- Understanding Quaternions and how to properly use them.
- Using Raycasting to detect surroundings of an object.
